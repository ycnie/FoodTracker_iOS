# FoodTracker_iOS


Things went smoothly until tutorial 3 "Implement a custom control".
No matter how I tried, I couldn't make the red button looks like what I set by adding constraints. Moreover, the steps following failed as well even though I have followed every steps in the tutorial.

So I downloaded the demonstration in section "Implement a custon control" and use it to continue the following tutorials.

After I have finished the section "Creat a Table View", everything goes normally.

Finally, I finished following steps and build an FoodTracker APP.
