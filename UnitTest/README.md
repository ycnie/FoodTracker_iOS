# TEST

This is the test for EC601 Homework2 iOS application FoodTracker.

### Part 1 Black Box Testing
* Generate your own test cases.
* Run your own black box testing

The testcases are shown in [TestCaseSheetFoodTracker.xlsx]()

### Part 2 Automated Testing
Since I failed to generate ```*.ipa``` file for testing my iOS application, I have tested one of my classmate Peixin Li's web Application.
I'll keep fixing the problems that I ran into when generatin ```*.ipa``` file. When I'm able to test my iOS application, I'll upgrade my Github. 

The result is shown as ```WebApp.png```.
